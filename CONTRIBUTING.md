## How to Contribute

### Create Bugs Issue

Before creating issue, please check the existing issues to avoid duplicates.  
When you create a bug issue, include as following content:

- A clear and descriptive title
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Code samples if applicable
- Version information (Node.js, ESLint, eslint-plugin-awscdk)

### Create Feature Request Issue

We welcome suggestions for new rules!
When proposing a new rule:

1. First, check existing rules and issues to avoid duplicates
2. Create an issue with the following information:
   - Rule name
   - Description of the problem the rule solves
   - Examples of code that should pass/fail
   - References to AWS CDK best practices if applicable

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. Implement the rules
3. Implement the test for the rule and make sure it passes. (Tests are run in CI)
4. Update the documentation
5. Create a pull request

#### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
https://github.com/ren-yamanashi/eslint-plugin-awscdk.git

# Install dependencies
vp env use
vp install --frozen-lockfile

# Run the default verification flow
vp check

# Run tests
vp test --run

# Run format
vp fmt
```

#### Creating a New Rule

1. Create a new file in `src/rules/`(file name should same rule name)
2. Create corresponding test file in `src/__tests__/`
3. Add rule to `src/index.ts`
4. Add documentation in `docs`

Note: Writing the document is optional (because it is written using Vitepress and is not yet ready to accept contributions)

Example rule structure:

```typescript
import { ESLintUtils } from "@typescript-eslint/utils";
import { createRule } from "../utils/createRule";

export const newRule = createRule({
  name: "sample-new-rule",
  meta: {
    type: "problem",
    docs: {
      description: "Rule description",
    },
    messages: {
      ruleError: "Error message with {{ placeholder }}",
    },
    schema: [],
  },
  defaultOptions: [],
  create(context) {
    // Rule implementation
  },
});
```
